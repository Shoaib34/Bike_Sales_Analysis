Features of the Dashboard:
Dynamic Slicers: Interactive slicers to filter the data by variables such as Age, Gender, Income, Marital Status, and Region.
Graphs: Various charts (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) to show trends in bike purchases based on customer characteristics.
Key Insights: Visualizations that highlight which customer segments are more likely to purchase bikes.
Technologies Used:
Excel: Data analysis and dashboard creation.
Pivot Tables: To summarize and analyze the data.
Pivot Charts: To visualize key data insights.
Slicers: To filter the data and interact with the dashboard dynamically.
